1) Install Redux and Redux Toolkit = $ npm install @redux/toolkit react-Redux

2) Create a redux folder inside src.

3) Inside redux folder create store.js . 

4) The store is nothing but container. It is Immutable.

5) The Basic syntax of store is we need to import configureStore from redux/toolkit . Then store it into store variable . And inside that register all the reducers.Also export the store.

6) Then inside the root folder of application (generally App.js) import store from '../store' and Provider from react-redux.

7) Wrap the whole App.js inside Provider and pass the store to Provider.

8) Create folder inside modules inside the perticular folder we will create slice of that folder . Normally the naming convention for Slice will be folder name then Slice in camel case.

9) Inside Slice need to import {createSlice} from redux/toolkit.

10)Store the initialState in a variable named as initialState.

11)create a object createSlice and assign to in createSlice. Export it also.

12)Inside createSlice write the name of slice , initialState and reducers.

13)Store all the reducers in the reducers object.(using state and action)

14)Export all the reducers and assign them createSlice.action

15)Also export Slice like sliceName.reducer.

16)Import the slice in Store.js

17)Inside reducer register it.
